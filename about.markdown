My name is Nym Seddon, and I do cryptography + code stuff.

Join me on my journey contributing, reviewing, and sometimes breaking (responsibly) cryptographic implementations and blockchain projects.

So much love for this field, want to share it with everyone!

If you would like to contact me to perform an audit of your project, please hit me up: [@unseddd:matrix.org](https://riot.im/app).

DISCLAIMER:

- I do not support, condone, nor promote irresponsible and/or malicious security testing / breaking / cracking.
- If that is your thing, this is not the right place for you.
